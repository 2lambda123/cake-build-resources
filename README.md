# Overview

This repository contains different kind of resources such as bootstrappers
and configuration files for use when building with
[Cake](https://cakebuild.net).

**Notice: As of November 2020 the two scripts
[build.ps1](./dotnet-framework/build.ps1) and
[build.sh](./dotnet-framework/build.sh) that previously existed
in the root folder are now moved to the [dotnet-framework](./dotnet-framework)
folder.**
